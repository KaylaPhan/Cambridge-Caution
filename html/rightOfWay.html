        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Right of way refers to a situation in which one party has the right to proceed when multiple parties meet in the same place and/or at the same time, like an intersection. Cambridge Caution is here to educate and protect all drivers, bikers, and pedestrians to keep Cambridge safe. Right of way is a code all should follow when commuting, to keep themselves and others out of harm. We want Cambridge to be a safe space for everyone, people should not be afraid to commute to work or school, hence why all drivers, bikers, and even pedestrians are expected to follow the right of way, as outlined in the following.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Right of way is a safety protocol that protects everyone on the road, but when people fail to follow it, it can lead to serious injuries and even fatalities. If a driver fails to yield the right of way to anyone else on the road, they risk colliding with another. These types of accidents are countless and happen every year due to right of way violations, it’s our job to help you help others by working on preventing them!</p>

      <h3>Common Scenarios</h3>

        <div class="fourWayStops-text">
          <h4>Four-Way Stops</h4>
          <div class="fourWayStops-img">
            <img class="fourWayStops-img" src="../images/fourWayInt.jpg" alt="four way stop model"/>
          </div>
          <p>Four-way Stops or any all-way stop can get quite confusing. But the first rules to know are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Motorists AND Cyclists must slow down and come to a complete stop approaching the intersection</li>
            <li>The driver who got at the intersection first gets to proceed first</li>
            <li>If two or more people happen to get there at the same time, the driver on the right should get to go first and the next on the right get to proceed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A common confusion is when drivers from all intersections happen to arrive at the intersection simultaneously. Although this case is very unlikely, drivers should ocmmunicate among each other with eye contact and hand waves, then follow the right of way rules from there.</p>
          <p>It's important to note, pedestrians usually don't have walk signals at these stop intersections in which motorists and cyclists should always yield to pedestrians.</p>

          <p>T intersections can get scary especially when you’re trying to turn with oncoming traffic. However the best thing to do is be patient and wait for clear, safe openings. You must always yield to the oncoming motorists before making your turn. And when turning left, be mindful of both sides of the road.</p>

      <p>When living in a very bike-dependent city, it can be difficult for motorists to be aware all the time. Nevertheless, it is necessary. It’s easy for motorist/cyclist collisions to occur, but it is important to prevent them. Motorists should participate in keeping bikers safe by:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slowing down when passing a biker moving in the same lane</li>
      <li>Always yielding the right of way to a vehicle coming from the opposite direction, including a bicycle</li>
      <li>Checking for bikers before opening the car door</li>
      <li>Yielding when turning left, even to a bicycle</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Cyclists</h3>
        <ion-icon class="typesIcon" name="bicycle"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <p>For cyclists, it is crucial to follow the rules of the road because it is that much more dangerous for them. Knowledge on what to do in certain circumstances can be the difference between life and death. Following are some basic examples of commonly overlooked laws that cyclists are expected to, but don’t usually, follow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cyclists must stop at all red lights and stop signs</li>
        <li>Signal intent by a hand to stop or turn (cyclists are exempt of this rule if it is unsafe to take hands off the handlebars)</li>
        <li>Bikers must bike with the flow of traffic, unless otherwise indicated by the signs</li>
        <li>If there is a bike lane, cyclists must bike within that lane, if there is no bike lane, cyclists may use the full lane if they wish</li>
        <li>Cyclists may ride on the sidewalk outside of business or heavily foot-trafficked districts, but still must yield to pedestrians and give them an audible signal of their presence</li>
        <li>Slow when approaching crosswalks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cyclists have the same responsibilities as drivers when it comes to keeping others safe, that means abiding by these laws drawn up for your safety.</p>

        <h3>Pedestrians</h3>
        <ion-icon class="typesIcon" name="walk"></ion-icon>
      </div>
      <p>Pedestrians are known to always have right of way over cars and bicycles, but that doesn’t mean they can do whatever they want. There are still rules, even for the most vulnerable of commuters. As a pedestrian you are expected to </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walk against the flow of traffic if the sidewalk is not wide enough for two streams of foot traffic</li>
        <li>Be patient with crosswalk signs, if the sign doesn’t say walk, don’t walk, you do not have right of way</li>
        <li>You always have right of way when crossing a street that has no light, but be safe anyway, look both ways, make sure the driver sees you, THEN walk.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is true that pedestrians always have right of way, but that doesn’t mean everyone always follows it, so be safe and be cautious.</p>
    </div> <!-- End of Pedestrians -->

  <p>If at any moment you see someone not practicing Right of Way, give them the right of way as to not put you or others in danger. Stay alert and be prepared to slow down and stop at any momemt.</p>
